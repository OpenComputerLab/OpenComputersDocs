# Computer Case

The Computer Case. Like their real-life counterparts, they house all of
the components that make the computer *run*.

In OpenComputers the cases come in four tiers of which only 3 are
craftable in survival. Each with better specs than the last. Below are
the styles of the case tiers. ![](/blocks/teir1case.png){width="128"}
![](/blocks/teir2case.png){width="128"}
![](/blocks/teir3case.png){width="128"}
![](/blocks/teir4case.png){width="128"}

## Tier 1

The first tier of case, cannot support much but it is a good starting
point nonetheless. Tier 1 cases provide room for:

- 2 x Tier 1 Expansion Cards - 1 x Tier 1 [Processor](/item/cpu) - 2 x
Tier 1 [RAM Modules](/item/memory) - 1 x Tier 1
[HDD](/item/hard_disk_drive)

Tier 1 cases are crafted with:

- 4 x Iron Ingot - 2 x Iron Bars - 1 x Chest - 1 x
[Microchip](/item/materials#microchips) - 1 x [Printed Circuit
Board](/item/materials#printed_circuit_board)

## Tier 2

The second tier of case, can do more than Tier 1 but not as much as Tier
3. Tier 2 cases provide room for:

- 1 x Tier 1 Expansion Card - 1 x Tier 2 Expansion Card - 1 x Tier 2
[Processor](/item/cpu) - 2 x Tier 2 [RAM Modules](/item/memory) - 1 x
Tier 1 [HDD](/item/hard_disk_drive) - 1 x Tier 2 HDD

Tier 2 cases are crafted with:

- 4 x Gold Ingot - 2 x Iron Bars - 1 x Chest - 1 x [Microchip (Tier
2)](/item/materials#microchips) - 1 x [Printed Circuit
Board](/item/materials#printed_circuit_board)

## Tier 3

The third tier of case, can pretty much do anything you want it to do.
Tier 3 cases provide room for:

- 1 x Tier 3 Expansion Card - 2 x Tier 2 Expansion Cards - 1 x Tier 3
[Processor](/item/cpu) - 2 x Tier 3 [RAM Modules](/item/memory) - 1 x
Tier 2 [HDD](/item/hard_disk_drive) - 1 x Tier 3 HDD - 1 x [Floppy
Disk](/item/floppy_disk)

Tier 3 cases are crafted with:

- 4 x Diamonds - 2 x Iron Bars - 1 x Chest - 1 x [Microchip (Tier
3)](/item/materials#microchips) - 1 x [Printed Circuit
Board](/item/materials#printed_circuit_board)
![](/recipes/blocks/tier3case.png){width="200"}

## Tier 4 (Creative)

The fourth tier of case, cannot be crafted in survival and only cheated
in using the Creative Inventory or NEI. Tier 4 cases provide room for:

- 3 x Tier 3 Expansion Cards - 1 x Tier 3 [Processor](/item/cpu) - 2 x
Tier 3 [RAM Modules](/item/memory) - 2 x Tier 3
[HDD](/item/hard_disk_drive) - 1 x [Floppy Disk](/item/floppy_disk)

Can be spawned with the command "/oc_sc". It will spawn a creative
case with a tier 3 hard drive, 2x tier 3.5 RAM sticks, a creative
[APU](/item/apu), and an [OpenOS floppy disk](/item/openos_floppy). It
will also spawn with a tier 2 monitor/screen with a keyboard on top. To
spawn this on multiplayer, you need at-least level 2 OP. You can spawn
this in single player without problems.
