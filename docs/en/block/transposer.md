# Transposer

![Such a poser.](oredict:oc:transposer)

The transposer bridges the gap between redstone controlled hoppers and
[Robot](/block/robot), allowing
[computer](/block/computer_case)-controlled transferal of items and
fluids between adjacent blocks.

*Note that this block has no internal inventory.*

Besides moving things around, it can also be used to inspect the
contents of the adjacent inventories, like an [Adapter](/block/adapter)
with an [inventory contoller](/component/inventory_controller) could,
and the contents of adjacent tanks, like and adapter with a [Tank
Controller](/component/tank_controller) could.

The transposer can also interactive with player inventory when player
stands next to or on it.

The component proxy on a computer provides an api as described
[here](/component/transposer)
