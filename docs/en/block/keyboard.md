# Keyboard

Can be attached to [screens](/block/screen) to allow typing on them.
Note that keyboards will only work on screens they are placed on or
point towards.

For multi-block screens it can very much matter *where* on the screen
you place the keyboard, since you have to be within range of the
keyboard to type - meaning you may be able to open the screen's GUI,
but not be able to type.

Note that a screen block for itself is just that. A screen. Displaying
stuff. Once you attach a keyboard to it, a GUI will open when you
right-click/activate it, allowing text input. Note that tier two and
three screens allow "clicking" them in the world directly (by
right-clicking/activating them), i.e. a `touch` signal will be
generated. They're touch-screens, so to speak. *This only works if
they have no keyboard*.

The Keyboard is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x [Button
Group](/item/materials#keyboard arrow keys/button group/numeric
    keypad) - 1 x [Arrow
Keys](/item/materials#keyboard arrow keys/button group/numeric
    keypad) - 1 x [Numeric
Keypad](/item/materials#keyboard arrow keys/button group/numeric
    keypad)
