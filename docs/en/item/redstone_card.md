Allows reading and emitting redstone signals around the computer or
robot. This uses [the same API](/component/redstone) as the
[Redstone I/O block](/block/redstone_io).

The second tier of this card allows interaction with other mods'
redstone extensions. If the respective mods are also installed, this
supports simple and bundled redstone signals for RedLogic and/or
MineFactory Reloaded's RedNet. It also supports wireless redstone
interaction with both the Chickenbones and the SlimeVoid versions of
Wireless Redstone.
