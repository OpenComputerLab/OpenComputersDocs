# Drone

Drones are built using a [Drone Case](/item/dronecase/) in the
[Assembler](/block/assembler). They are entity-based "robots", a
little cheaper but with more limited functionality. They can **not**
interact with external components!

They have no secondary storage and so are programmed entirely by using
an [eeprom](/item/eeprom/). Once assembled, a drone can be reprogrammed
by crafting it with a new eeprom (its old eeprom is returned).
