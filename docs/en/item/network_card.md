Allows distant computers connected by other blocks (such as cable) to
communicate by sending messages to each other.

send and receive messages.

The Network Card is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x [Cable](/block/cable)
- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Card Base](/item/materials)
