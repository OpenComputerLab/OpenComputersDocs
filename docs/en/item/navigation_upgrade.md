**Provides**: [navigation](/component/navigation) component.

Allows the robot to tell its current position and facing. The position
is relative to the center of the map that was used to craft the upgrade.
The range in which the upgrade works depends on the size of the map that
was used to craft the upgrade. The upgrade can be crafted together with
another map to re-configure it and get the old map back.

The Navigation upgrade is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Gold Ingot
- 1 x Compass
- 2 x [Microchip (Tier 2)](/item/materials)
- 1 x Map
- 1 x Potion / Filled Water Bottle
