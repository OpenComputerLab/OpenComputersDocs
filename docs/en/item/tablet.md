Tablets are built by placing a [Tablet Case](/item/tablet_case) into an
[Assembler](/block/assembler), configuring as desired and assembling it.
Tablets act as portable computers that cannot directly interact with the
world - for example [Redstone Cards](/item/redstone_card) do *not*
work in them. A number of upgrades, however, do, such as the [Sign
Upgrade](/item/sign_upgrade) or the [Piston
Upgrade](/item/piston_upgrade).

To force rebooting a tablet, shift-rightclick it while holding it in
your hand. Unlike computers, tablets do *not* persist across the
player holding leaving and re-entering the game. They also do not
persist across the player holding the tablet changing dimensions (e.g.
going to the nether or back).

Tablets can be put into a [Charger](/block/charger) to refill their
energy and to access the first hard disk built into the tablet from a
computer connected to the charger - in this setup, the charger will act
similar to a disk drive, with the tablet being the floppy disk. This can
be very useful in case you forgot to install an OS on the hard drive
built into the tablet, or after bricking a tablet's OS.

*Since version 1.7.3 for minecraft 1.12* Tablets can **also** be
charged by Forge Energy compatible machines, such as Thermal
Expansion's Energetic Infuser.
