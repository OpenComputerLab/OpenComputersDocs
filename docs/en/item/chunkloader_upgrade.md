# Chunkloader Upgrade

![](https://ocdoc.cil.li/_media/items:chunkloader_upgrade.png)

This upgrade allows robots and drones to act as a one-chunk chunkloader,
allowing them to continue to operate even when no player is nearby /
some other chunkloader is active. Note that this upgrade consumes energy
when active - it provides [a component](/component/chunkloader) that can
be used enable or disable it.

The default condition for the chunkloader after installation in a robot
is **enabled**. Use the [component.setActive()](/component/chunkloader)
callback to change the status.

*Since version 1.3.*

The Chunkloader Upgrade is crafted using the following recipe:

- 2 x Obsidian
- 2 x Gold ingot
- 1 x Eye of Ender
- 1 x Glass
- 2 x [Microchip (Tier 3)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
