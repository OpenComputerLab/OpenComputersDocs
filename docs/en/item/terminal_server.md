# Terminal Server

![](/items/terminalserver.png){width="128"}

The Terminal Server can be bound to [remote terminals](/item/terminal)
which provides a remote accessible tier 3 screen and keyboard. Terminal
servers are blades that fit in [racks](/block/server_rack), and need to
share a configured side (see the rack gui) with a server blade to be
connected. Terminal servers have a range limit equal to a tier 2
wireless card.

The Terminal Server is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Obsidian Block - 1 x [Wireless Network Card (Tier
2)](/item/wireless_network_card) - 1 x [Microchip (Tier
2)](/item/materials) - 1 x Printed Circuit Board
