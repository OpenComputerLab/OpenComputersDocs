This item is used in an [Assembler](/block/assembler) to build
[Microcontrollers](/block/microcontroller), which are essentially
cheaper and minimalistic computers, intended for special use-cases, such
as redstone control.

## Tier 1

The Microcontroller case (Tier 1) can house the following components (up
to the specified tier):

- [CPU (Tier 1)](/item/cpu)
- [Memory (Tier 1)](/item/memory)
- [EEPROM](/item/eeprom)
- Expansion card (Tier 1)
- Upgrade (Tier 2)

The Microcontroller Case (Tier 1) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Iron nugget/oreberry (with Tinker's Construct)
- 2 x Redstone dust
- 1 x Chest
- 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials)

## Tier 2

The Microcontroller case (Tier 2) can house the following components (up
to the specified tier):

- [CPU (Tier 1)](/item/cpu)
- [Memory (Tier 1)](/item/memory)
- [EEPROM](/item/eeprom)
- Expansion card (Tier 1)
- Expansion card (Tier 2)
- Upgrade (Tier 3)

The Microcontroller case (Tier 2) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Gold nugget/oreberry (with Tinker's Construct)
- 2 x Block of Redstone
- 1 x Chest
- 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 3)](/item/materials)

## Tier 4 (Creative)

The Creative Microcontroller case can house the following components (up
to the specified tier):

- [CPU (Tier 3)](/item/cpu)
- Expansion slot (Tier 3)
- [Memory (Tier 3)](/item/memory)
- [EEPROM](/item/eeprom)
- Upgrades (Tier 3)
