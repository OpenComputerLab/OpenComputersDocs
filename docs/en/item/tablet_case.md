Tablet cases are used to build [tablets](/item/tablet), which are
handheld computers. A creative tablet case also exists for playing
around with different configurations in Creative mode.

Tablets take a limited subset of upgrades, unlike Robots. Tablets also
have access to only one upgrade or card container slot (Tier 2 and
Creative).
