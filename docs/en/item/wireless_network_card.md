There are 2 tiers of wireless card. Maximum strength is 16 for tier 1
and 400 for tier 2 (default values). Wireless packets can *not* be
lost but a may be out of range. On top of that, tier 1 can't receive
packages from tier 2 card when the distance exceeds 16 (default values).

The tier 1 wireless card can only send and receive wireless packets, it
does not use the wired network. Tier 2 wireless cards transmit both
wired and wireless packets.

This is an upgrade to [normal network cards](/item/lan_card) that allows
wireless sending of network messages in addition to normal ones.

Signal strength can be adjusted. Low strength reduces the distance the
packets can travel and reduced the power it costs to send them. By
default, the strength is max. The hardness of blocks in the path is
subtracted from the strength. Some randomness is applied to the
strength.

The Tier 1 Wireless Network Card is crafted using the following recipe:

- 2 x redstone torch
- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Card Base](/item/materials)

The Tier 2 Wireless Network Card is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x Ender Pearl
- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 2)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Card Base](/item/materials)
