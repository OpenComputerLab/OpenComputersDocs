This upgrade provides inventory space to a robot. You will usually want
to install at least one of these in a robot. Each upgrade provides an
additional 16 inventory slots, up to a maximum of 64 slots. Thus, adding
more than 4 inventory upgrades has no effect.

*Since version 1.3.*

The Inventory Upgrade is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Planks
- 1 x Piston
- 1 x Dropper
- 1 x Chest
- 1 x Hopper
- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials)
