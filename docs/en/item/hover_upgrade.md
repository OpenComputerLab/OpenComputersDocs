# Hover Upgrade

The Hover upgrade is a [robot](/block/robot) upgrade that allows the
robot to hover higher above the ground. Normally, a
[robot](/block/robot) is able to reach a maximum height of 8 blocks, and
can also move along walls. The hover upgrade increases that limit to 64
blocks (tier 1) or 256 blocks (tier 2).

The Hover upgrade (tier 1) is crafted using the following recipe:
