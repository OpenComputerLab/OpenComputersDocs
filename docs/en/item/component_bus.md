A component bus has similar functionality as a CPU, it controls the
number of components that can be connected to a computer before it will
not start anymore / crash. It does not replace a CPU however. At the
time of writing, component buses can only be built into servers,
allowing them to support a much larger number of concurrent components
than normal computers.

The Component Bus (Tier 1) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Iron nugget/oreberry
- 1 x Redstone dust
- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Control Unit](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
