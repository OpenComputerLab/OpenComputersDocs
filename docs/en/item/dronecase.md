This item is used in an [Assembler](/block/assembler) to build
[Drones](/item/drone), which are kind of to robots what microcontrollers
are to computers. They are more limited, specialized versions. In this
case they also have some additional functionality, though: they move
differently (because they are entities) and have other options for
interacting with the world, too, such as via using the [Leash
Upgrade](/item/leash_upgrade).

The Drone Case (Tier 1) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x End Stone
- 1 x [Microcontroller Case (Tier 1)](/item/microcontrollercase)
- 1 x Compass
- 2 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Component Bus (Tier 2)](/item/component_bus)
