# Interoperation with other Mods

OpenComputers interfaces with a lot of different mods, and many mods
make use of OpenComputers' API, too. Here is a list of mods that are
either supported by OC or support OC. No guarantee for completeness or
correctness.

## Power

- Applied Energistics 2 - Electical Age \
      //ELN provides an adapter for OC.//
- Factorization - Galacticraft
- IndustrialCraft 2 (Experimental and Classic)
- Mekanism
- Redstone Flux (Thermal Expansion, BuildCraft, EnderIO)
- Universal Electricity - Simple Generators

## Redstone

OpenComputers supports the major bundled and wireless redstone systems.

- Project Red
- Minefactory's RedNET
- Redlogic
- Slimevoid's Wireless Redstone
- Wireless Redstone CBE

## Networking

OpenComputers can interface with the following mods to send network
messages.

- ComputerCraft\
      Switch and Access Point blocks act as CC peripherals that emulate
      the CC modem API.

- StargateTech 2\
      //Abstract Bus card can be use to send and receive Abstract Bus
      messages.//

## Microblocks / Cover Systems

OpenComputers supports the following systems for covering cables.

- Forge MultiPart - Immibis' Microblocks\
      //Can also be used to cover keyboards.//

## Other Mods

A couple of mods support OC on their own, allowing computers to interact
with some of their blocks, for example.

- Big Reactors
- BluePower (Sortron)
- Enhanced Portals 3
- LanteaCraft
- Logistics Pipes
- Nuclear Control 2
- RotaryCraft and ReactorCraft
- ThaumicTinkerer (Golem Connector)
- Networks Manager

## Addons

There are numerous addons that add blocks and items or drivers (support
for other mods' blocks) specifically designed to work with
OpenComputers. Please see [the according section on the
forums](<http://oc.cil.li/index.php?/forum/36-addons-mods/>) and the
[Addon page on this wiki](/addon) for more information!

## Adapter

What was previously the OpenComponents addon is built into OC as of
version 1.4. There are many drivers for the Adapter block to allow
interfacing blocks from a number of other mods. It also allows using
most of CC's peripherals, if CC is installed.
