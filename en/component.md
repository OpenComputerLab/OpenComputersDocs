# Components

Components that can be accessed from Lua provide their own APIs. This
section is the bastard child of the Blocks and Items section and the
[Lua API section](api). Read the [article on component
interaction](/component/component_access) to learn how to obtain access
to these APIs.

You'll also want to have a look at the [signals](/component/signals)
overview, to get an idea what signals (events) can be queued by which
components.

## OpenComputers Components

These components come with the mod and allow interacting with blocks or
items of the mod itself.

## Adapter Block Components

These components are for blocks from vanilla Minecraft and other mods
that become available when said blocks are placed next to an [Adapter
block](/block/adapter).
