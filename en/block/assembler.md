# Assembler

![](/blocks/assembler.png){width="128"}

This machine is used to assemble a robot from its individual parts. You
can configure your robot in a lot of detail here, but keep in mind that
most parts will be fixed once the robot is assembled, so choose wisely.
Assembly takes a short amount of time, but consumes a good bit of
energy.

For a basic robot you will generally want to add the parts you also use
to build a computer, i.e. a CPU, RAM, a medium with an operating system
on it, and unless you want a "headless" robot, a screen, a keyboard
and a GPU.

*Since version 1.3.*

The Assembler is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Iron Ingot - 1 x Crafting Table - 2 x Piston (or Sticky Piston) -
1 x [Microchip (Tier 2)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit
Board](/item/materials)
