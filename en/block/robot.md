Unlike computers, robots can move around and interact with the world
much like a player can. They can **not** interact with external
components, however! If you need to communicate with a computer or other
robots, use a [Wireless Network Card](/item/wlan_card) or create some
low-level protocol using redstone signals via a [Redstone
Card](/item/redstone_card), for example.

Robots are built by placing a [Computer Case](/block/computer_case) in
an [Assembler](/block/assembler).
