# Power Distributor

![](/blocks/power_distributor.png){width="128"}

Distributes energy between different networks. This can be useful for
powering multiple sub-networks that should not connect to each other.
For example, you'll usually want to try and keep different computers in
different networks - unless you have a startup script on each computer
that manually assigns the primary components. Otherwise you'll
frequently end up with the computers binding the wrong screen and/or
keyboard on startup, for example, or even multiple computer binding to
the same screen.

The Power Distributor is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Iron Ingot - 1 x Gold Ingot - 2 x [Cable](/block/cable) - 1 x
[Printed Circuit Board](/item/crafting_items)
