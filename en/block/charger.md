# Charger

![](/blocks/charger.png){width="128"}

Transfers energy from capacitors into adjacent robots. The transfer rate
depends on the incoming redstone signal, where no signal means don't
charge robots, and maximum strength means charge at full speed.

You'll need one of these to get your robots running. There is the
[generator upgrade](/item/generator_upgrade), but you can only put fuel
into the generator via the API, meaning you have to get *some* energy
into your robot some other way, first. And that way is the Charger
block.

The Charger is crafted using the following recipe:

- 2 x [Capacitor](/block/capacitor) - 1 x [Microchip (Tier
2)](/item/materials) - 4 x Iron ingot - 1 x Gold ingot - 1 x [Printed
Circuit Board](/item/materials)
