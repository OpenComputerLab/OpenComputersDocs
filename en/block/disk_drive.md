# Disk Drive

![](/blocks/disk_drive.png){width="128"}

Allows reading and writing [floppies](/item/floppy). ComputerCraft
floppies are also supported.

The main use of floppies - except being cheaper than hard drives - is to
get data onto robots, since they cannot connect to external components,
and only have a component slot for floppies, but not for hard drives. If
you have the materials, you can build a tier three case, which has a
built-in disk drive. Until then, this block is your new best friend.

The Disk Drive is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Iron ingot - 1 x Piston - 1 x Stick - 1 x [Microchip (Tier
1)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
