# Redstone I/O

![](/blocks/redstone_io.png){width="128"}

Allows reading and emitting redstone signals around the block. Can be
controlled by any computer the block is connected to. This is basically
like an external [redstone card](/item/redstone_card).

- This also supports RedLogic wires, if present, including colored and

      bundled wires.

- This also supports MineFactory Reloaded RedNet cables. - This also
supports Project: Red wires, including colored and bundled

      wires.

Like redstone cards, this offers the [redstone
component](/component/redstone) API. Note that while redstone cards rely
on the container's orientation for the sides in their API, the redstone
I/O block always uses absolute directions, e.g. `sides.north`.

The Redstone I/O block is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4x Iron ingot - 2 x Redstone Block - 1 x [Microchip (Tier
3)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Redstone Card (Tier 1)](/item/redstone_card)
- 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
