This upgrade can be used to store item stack information. It can be
configured by open its GUI by right clicking holding it in your hand and
placing items in it (no actual items are stored in the item, clicking
with an item in the grid will store a "ghost" stack). Alternatively, a
few components allow configuring the database programmatically, such as
the [Inventory Controller Upgrade](/item/inventory_controller_upgrade)
and the [Geolyzer](/block/geolyzer).
