CPUs, while not acting as components, are required to make a computer
start up. They also control the number of components that can be
connected to a computer before it will not start anymore / crash.

using the following recipe:

- 4 x Iron nugget/oreberry (with Tinker's Construct)
- 1 x Redstone dust
