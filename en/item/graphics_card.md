Used to change what's displayed on screens. Computers can control the
buffer of a bound [screen](/block/screen) via the [GPU's
API](/component/gpu).

- Maximum resolution: 50x16/80x25/160x50. - Maximum color depth: 1/4/8.
- Operations/tick: 1,1,4,2,2/2,4,8,4,4/4,8,16,8,8.

The operations refer to, from left to right: `copy`, `fill`,
`set`, `setBackground` and `setForeground`. The number indicates
the number *direct* calls that can be made to each of these functions
on the graphics card *per tick* before an indirect call has to be
made. See the [page on component
interaction](/component/component_access) for more information on direct
calls.

The Graphics Card (Tier 1) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x [Arithmetic Logic Unit](/item/materials) - 1 x [Card
Base](/item/materials) - 1 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials) - 1 x
[Memory (Tier 1)](/item/memory)

The Graphics Card (Tier 2) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x [Arithmetic Logic Unit](/item/materials) - 1 x [Card
Base](/item/materials) - 1 x [Microchip (Tier 2)](/item/materials) - 1 x
[Memory (Tier 2)](/item/memory)
