Hard disk drives (HDDs) come in three tiers, with increasing storage
capacity (each tier's capacity is configurable). They can store more
data than a simple floppy, but are also more expensive to craft. They
can also only be installed in [computer cases](/block/case) and
[servers](/item/server). They can *only* be installed in robots during
the assembly phase. (Prior to 1.3: They can *not* be installed in
robots.)

The Hard Disk Drive (Tier 1) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 3 x [Disk Platter](/item/materials)
- 2 x Iron Ingot
- 2 x [Microchip (Tier 1)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
- 1 x Piston

- 2 x Gold Ingot
- 2 x [Microchip (Tier 2)](/item/materials)
- 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
