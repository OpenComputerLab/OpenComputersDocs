Memory (RAM) comes in six tiers, with increasing sizes (each tier's
size is configurable). They fall into the three item tiers like so: {1,
1.5}, {2, 2.5}, {3, 3.5}. Memory isn't really a component, since it
does not provide any Lua callbacks, but it can be installed into
[computer cases](/block/case) to increase the available RAM of the
computer, which allows running more complex programs.

The Memory (Tier 1) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x Iron nugget/oreberry (with Tinker's Construct) - 2 x [Microchip
(Tier 1)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit
Board](/item/materials)

The Memory (Tier 1.5) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 2)](/item/materials) - 2 x [Microchip (Tier
1)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)

The Memory (Tier 2) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x Iron nugget/oreberry (with Tinker's Construct) - 2 x [Microchip
(Tier 2)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit
Board](/item/materials)

The Memory (Tier 2.5) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x [Microchip (Tier 3)](/item/materials) - 2 x [Microchip (Tier
2)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)

The Memory (Tier 3) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 1 x Iron nugget/oreberry (with Tinker's Construct) - 2 x [Microchip
(Tier 3)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit
Board](/item/materials)

The Memory (Tier 3.5) is crafted using the following recipe:

- 3 x [Microchip (Tier 3)](/item/materials) - 2 x [Microchip (Tier
2)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
