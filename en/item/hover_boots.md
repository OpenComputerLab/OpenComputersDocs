# Hover Boots

Hover boots, when worn, allow players to jump higher and reduce the
falling impact. The boots also allow players to walk up steps of
one-block height, making it easier to climb up mountains.

Boots require power, and can be re-charged in any compatible
[charger](/block/charger) (such as Applied Energistics 2 charger, or
IndustrialCraft 2's battery box).

*Since version 1.7.3 for minecraft 1.12* Hover Boots can **also** be
charged by any Forge Energy compatible machines, such as Thermal
Expansion's Energetic Infuser.

Hover Boots are crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Iron nugget
- 2 x Leather
- 1 x [Capacitor](/block/capacitor)
- 1 x Hover upgrade (tier 2)
- 1 x [Drone case (tier 1)](/item/dronecase)
