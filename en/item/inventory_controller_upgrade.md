# Inventory Controller Upgrade

![](/items/inventory_controller_upgrade.png){width="128"}

**Provides:** Component API [Inventory
Controller](/component/inventory_controller)

This upgrade allows the robot to interact in a more controlled fashion
with inventories in the world.

Robots with this upgrade can read additional item information, suck and
drop items from and into specific slots of an inventory and equip items
on their own. This is particularly useful for interacting with advanced
machines, where items have to go into specific slots, but can also come
in handy for sorting systems or automated crafting.

*Since version 1.3.*

The Inventory Controller upgrade is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Gold Ingot - 1 x Piston - 1 x Dropper - 1 x
[Analyzer](/item/analyzer) - 1 x [Microchip (Tier 2)](/item/materials) -
1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
