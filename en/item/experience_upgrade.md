# Experience Upgrade

![](/items/experience_upgrade.png){width="128"}

This upgrade allows robots to gain experience. The more experience
stored in this upgrade, the faster robots will be able to harvest blocks
(i.e. the time it takes to break an ore block decreases, for example)
and the more efficiently they will be able to use their tools (tools
will take damage less quickly). They can also store more energy for each
level they gain.

*Since version 1.3.*

The Experience Upgrade is crafted using the following recipe:

- 4 x Gold Ingot - 1 x Emerald - 2 x [Microchip (Tier
2)](/item/materials) - 1 x [Printed Circuit Board](/item/materials)
