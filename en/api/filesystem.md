# Filesystem API

This library allows a general way of interacting with file system
components. While each component is it's own "folder", these folders
can be "mounted" somewhere into a global directory tree. This allows
seamlessly interacting on multiple file system components. Not to be
confused with the [Filesystem component](/component/filesystem) with
which this API works.

- `filesystem.isAutorunEnabled(): boolean`

      Returns whether autorun is currently enabled. If this is `true`,
      newly mounted file systems will be checked for a file named
      `autorun[.lua]` in their root directory. If such a file exists, it
      is executed.

- `filesystem.setAutorunEnabled(value: boolean)`

      Sets whether autorun files should be ran on startup.

- `filesystem.canonical(path: string): string`

      Returns the canonical form of the specified path, i.e. a path
      containing no "indirections" such as `.` or `..`. For example, the
      paths `/tmp/../bin/ls.lua` and `/bin/./ls.lua` are equivalent, and
      their canonical form is `/bin/ls.lua`.
      Note that this function truncates relative paths to their topmost
      "known" directory. For example, `../bin/ls.lua` becomes
      `bin/ls.lua`. It stays a relative path, however - mind the lack of a
      leading slash.

- `filesystem.segments(path: string): table`

      Returns a table containing one entry for each //canonical// segment
      of the given path. Examples:

      -   `filesystem.segments("foo/bar")` -> `{"foo","bar"}`
      -   `filesystem.segments("foo/bar/../baz")` -> `{"foo","baz"}`

- `filesystem.concat(pathA: string, pathB: string[, ...]): string`

      Concatenates two or more paths. Note that all paths other than the
      first are treated as relative paths, even if they begin with a
      slash. The canonical form of the resulting concatenated path is
      returned, so `fs.concat("a", "..")` results in an empty string.

- `filesystem.path(path: string): string`

      Returns the path component of a path to a file, i.e. everything
      before the last slash in the canonical form of the specified path.

- `filesystem.name(path: string): string`

      Returns the file name component of a path to a file, i.e. everything
      after the last slash in the canonical form of the specified path.

- `filesystem.proxy(filter: string): table or nil, string`

      This is similar to `component.proxy`, except that the specified
      string may also be a file system component's label. We check for
      the label first, if no file system has the specified label we fall
      back to `component.proxy`. Returns the proxy of the specified file
      system, or `nil` and an error message if no file system matching the
      specified filter was found.

- `filesystem.mount(fs: table or string, path: string): boolean or
nil, string`

      Mounts a file system at the specified path. The first parameter can
      be either a file system component's proxy, its address or its
      label. The second is a path into the global directory tree. Returns
      true if the file system was successfully mounted, `nil` and an error
      message otherwise.

- `filesystem.mounts(): function -> table, string`

      Returns an iterator function over all currently mounted file system
      component's proxies and the paths at which they are mounted. This
      means the same proxy may appear multiple times, but with different
      mount paths.

- `filesystem.umount(fsOrPath: table or string): boolean`

      Unmounts a file system. The parameter can either be a file system
      component's proxy or (abbreviated) address, in which case all mount
      points of this file system will be removed, or a path into the
      global directory structure, in which case the file system mount
      containing that directory will be unmounted.

- `filesystem.isLink(path: string): boolean[, string]`

      Checks if the object at the specified path is a symlink, if so
      returns the path to where it links (as of 1.3.3).

- `filesystem.link(target: string, linkpath: string): boolean or nil,
string`

      Creates a symbolic link to the specified target path at the
      specified path. This is a 'soft' link, i.e. it the target file
      does not actually have to exist at the time of creation, and the
      link will not be deleted if the target file is deleted. Symbolic
      links do not persist across reboots.

- `filesystem.get(path: string): table, string or nil, string`

      Gets the file system component's proxy that contains the specified
      path. Returns the proxy and mount path, or `nil` and an error
      message.

- `filesystem.exists(path: string): boolean`

      Checks whether a file or folder exist at the specified path.

- `filesystem.size(path: string): number`

      Gets the file size of the file at the specified location. Returns 0
      if the path points to anything other than a file.

- `filesystem.isDirectory(path: string): boolean`

      Gets whether the path points to a directory. Returns false if not,
      either because the path points to a file, or `file.exists(path)` is
      false.

- `filesystem.lastModified(path: string): number`

      Returns the *real world* unix timestamp of the last time the file at
      the specified path was modified. For directories this is usually the
      time of their creation.

- `filesystem.list(path: string): function -> string or nil, string`

      Returns an iterator over all elements in the directory at the
      specified path. Returns `nil` and an error messages if the path is
      invalid or some other error occurred.
      Note that directories usually are postfixed with a slash, to allow
      identifying them without an additional call to `fs.isDirectory`.

- `filesystem.makeDirectory(path: string): boolean or nil, string`

      Creates a new directory at the specified path. Creates any parent
      directories that do not exist yet, if necessary. Returns `true` on
      success, `nil` and an error message otherwise.

- `filesystem.remove(path: string): boolean or nil, string`

      Deletes a file or folder. If the path specifies a folder, deletes
      all files and subdirectories in the folder, recursively. Return
      `true` on success, `nil` and an error message otherwise.

- `filesystem.rename(oldPath: string, newPath: string): boolean or
nil, string`

      Renames a file or folder. If the paths point to different file
      system components this will only work for files, because it actually
      perform a copy operation, followed by a deletion if the copy
      succeeds.
      Returns `true` on success, `nil` and an error message otherwise.

- `filesystem.copy(fromPath: string, toPath: string): boolean or nil,
string`

      Copies a file to the specified location. The target path has to
      contain the target file name. Does not support folders.

- `filesystem.open(path: string[, mode: string]): table or nil,
string`

      Opens a file at the specified path for reading or writing. If mode
      is not specified it defaults to "r". Possible modes are: `r`,
      `rb`, `w`, `wb`, `a` and `ab`.
      Returns a file stream (see below) on success, `nil` and an error
      message otherwise.
      Note that you can only open a limited number of files per file
      system at the same time. Files will be automatically closed when the
      garbage collection kicks in, but it is generally a good idea to call
      `close` on the file stream when done with the file.
      **Important**: it is generally recommended to use `io.open` instead
      of this function, to get a buffered wrapper for the file stream.

When opening files directly via the file system API you will get a file
stream, a table with four functions. These functions are thin wrappers
to the file system proxy's callbacks, which also means that read/write
operations are *not* buffered, and can therefore be slow when reading
few bytes often. You'll usually want to use `io.open` instead.

- `<file:close>()`

      Closes the file stream, releasing the handle on the underlying file
      system.

- `<file:read(n>: number): string or nil, string`

      Tries to read the specified number of bytes from the file stream.
      Returns the read string, which may be shorter than the specified
      number. Returns `nil` when the end of the stream was reached.
      Returns `nil` and an error message if some error occurred.

- `<file:seek(whence>: string[, offset: number]): number or nil,
string`

      Jumps to the specified position in the file stream, if possible.
      Only supported by file streams opened in read mode. The first
      parameter determines the relative location to seek from and can be
      `cur` for the current position, `set` for the beginning of the
      stream and `end` for the end of the stream. The second parameter is
      the offset by which to modify the position. Returns the new position
      or `nil` and an error message if some error occurred.
      The default value for the second parameter is 0, so `f:seek("set")`
      will reset the position to the start of the file, `f:seek("cur")`
      will return the current position in the file.

- `<file:write(str>: value): boolean or nil, string`

      Writes the specified data to the stream. Returns `true` on success,
      `nil` and an error message otherwise.
